# 📊 Understanding Curator Results

This guide helps you interpret validation results and make informed decisions about your content.

## 🎯 Quality Scoring System

The curator uses a **100-point scoring system** for each content item:

| Score Range | Quality Level | Action Required |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **90-100** | 🟢 Excellent | No action needed |
| **80-89** | 🟡 Good | Minor review recommended |
| **70-79** | 🟠 Fair | Review suggested |
| **60-69** | 🔴 Poor | Requires attention |
| **0-59** | ❌ Critical | Immediate action required |

### **Quarantine Threshold: 70 Points**
Items scoring below 70 are automatically quarantined for review.

## 🎯 Making Review Decisions

### **When to Approve ✅**

#### **Content is Fundamentally Correct**
- Location is accurate (Toronto-area)
- Information is useful to visitors
- Just needs category adjustment

#### **Examples from Toronto Guide:**
```
✅ "Ossington Strip Bar Crawl"
   → Approve and move to happy-hours
   → Reasoning: Valid Toronto activity, wrong category

✅ "Blue Jays Game at Rogers Centre"  
   → Approve and move to sporting-events
   → Reasoning: Professional sport, was in amateur section
```

### **When to Reject ❌**

#### **Content is Fundamentally Wrong**
- Wrong geographic location
- Outdated/irrelevant information
- Duplicate entries
- Broken/incomplete data

#### **Examples from Toronto Guide:**
```
❌ "Old Montreal Walking Tour"
   → Reject
   → Reasoning: Montreal content in Toronto guide

❌ "Thunder Bay Wilderness Adventure"
   → Reject  
   → Reasoning: 15+ hours travel time, not a day trip
```
